# LumiaFixer

An unofficial program that attempts to fix bricked Lumia devices.


## How it works

LumiaFixer uses the official tools provided by Microsoft to try and recover the device, to run LumiaFixer you need the official [Windows Device Recovery Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569) program installed on your computer, else it will not work, you also need the FFU and emergency files for your specific model (RM)

LumiaFixer will ask you for the FFU & emergency files and will then attempt to recover your phone using a program that's in the WDRT program files, while the process could fix your phone it could also not work for a multitude of reasons such as driver issues or bad installation of WDRT.

If you have issues go to the "Issues" section of this README.
## Issues

**"Only Sahara based emergency download is currently supported"**

This issue can usually be fixed by going to your control panel, programs & repairing the install of Windows Device Recovery Tool, if this doesn't work for you [please create an issue](https://github.com/herbodytea/LumiaFixer/issues/new) and we will try to help you.
## Legal
